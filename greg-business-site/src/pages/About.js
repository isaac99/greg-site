            Hello!

            My name is Greg and I appreciate you taking a moment to get to know me. Ever since my middle school days, I have taken great pleasure assisting other students in achieving their academic goals. As a college graduate, I have a comprehensive, refined understanding of a wide range of subjects and I'm excited to share my knowledge with students of all ages and abilities. I love working on a personal level with students as it allows me to cater my tutoring techniques to each student's unique personality. I believe we all learn differently, and I design my instruction to fit my students' preferred methods of learning. I adhere to a policy of positivity and honesty, and I offer direct, constructive, and uplifting feedback to my students. Students often improve their skills and knowledge through practicing the material, so I design "homework" assignments geared toward improving students' weaknesses and reinforcing their strengths.

            I was Valedictorian of my high school class in 2010 and I was an AP National Scholar. I graduated Vanderbilt University in May 2014 with a degree in Neuroscience and a degree in English. Through my Neuroscience major, I have taken all of Vanderbilt's introductory sciences (including laboratory work) and I carried my math education through the level of multivariable calculus.

            My English studies were focused on literary analysis and creative writing. I was a member of the College Scholars Honors Program through my four years at Vanderbilt and I held myself to a high academic standard.

            I consider myself a professional in-home tutor. I have been providing full-time tutoring services for the past two and a half years, and I've taught students of all ages, abilities, and needs. The grade-levels of my students range from elementary to college undergraduates. I most frequently work with students on math, chemistry, biology, and physics, though I have also tutored students in the social sciences (political science, psychology, sociology, and anthropology). Many of my students work with me specifically on improving their writing skills. Additionally, I tutor high school students in SAT and ACT preparation and I am thoroughly familiar with the tests' structures and best strategies with which to attack the tests.

            The majority of my students have been studying with me for a year or more, and I'm happy to provide numerous references evaluating the quality of my teaching. Additionally, I am employed by three different families as a homeschool teacher. Each family asks me to teach full courses to their children several times a week. The courses I currently teach are AP Chemistry, AP US History, Physics I, AP Literature and Composition, Geometry, Algebra, and Pre-Calculus. The curriculum is designed to give the children a more in-depth, comprehensive understanding of the subject matter than they would otherwise receive in a traditional school system. If you are interested in a homeschool education, I would be happy to discuss options for subjects.

            Through Vanderbilt University's Writing Studio, I worked as a Writing Consultant for two years. During this time, I held over 300 face-to-face, one-hour writing consultations with undergraduate students, graduate students, post-doctorates, and school faculty. I assisted my clients with all stages of the writing process--reading and analyzing literature, brainstorming paper topics, developing a thesis, organizing arguments, coherently expressing thoughts, proofreading, editing, outlining, and formatting. I am highly trained in working with writing in all subject fields and all formats, and I have extensive experience tutoring individuals whose first language is not English.
